        <h1>Funding Sources</h1>
    </div>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
<div class="col-sm-9"><h1 class="display-2">Justice Democrats (PAC/hybrid)</h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Justice Democrats is a left-wing political organization and hybrid PAC that recruits and backs progressive primary challengers and established Democrats to fight under one banner. They focus on Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, ending corporate PAC influence, and removing incumbents who they see as beholden to corporate money.</p>
<p><strong>How they help me:</strong> Justice Democrats provide coordinated endorsements, fundraising support, volunteer leads, digital promotion, and independent ad buys targeting primaries. They carry credibility with progressive small donors and activist networks, which help push a primary campaign from dark horses to leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 2023–24 federal cycle: $3.43 million in outside spending (OpenSecrets).</p>
<p><strong>Why it fits my campaign:</strong> Justice Democrats target exactly the kind of far-left progressive insurgency that I will role-play. They, like me, are anti-corporate, pro-labor, and bold on climate and health care.</p>

<h1 class="display-2">Working Families Party (WFP)</h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Working Families Party is a progressive political party and independent expenditure group that cross-endorses progressive Democrats and runs independent campaigns to elect pro-labor, pro-housing, and pro-Medicaid for All candidates. They also run local voter mobilization and ballot measure campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>How they can help me:</strong> WFP brings on-the-ground grassroots organizing infrastructure, ballot access expertise, and a reliable base of union and community activists. In swing or close races, their local mobilization can flip turnout margins, and their endorsement signals to progressive voters that a credible candidate is serious about economic justice.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 2023–24 federal cycle: $6.5 million in outside spending (OpenSecrets), plus heavy investment in state/local races and grassroots mobilization.</p>
<p><strong>Why they fit my campaign:</strong> WFP’s focus on living wages, tenant protections, and labor power aligns with a far-left platform centered on working-class economic reforms.</p>

<h1 class="display-2">Sunrise Movement / Sunrise Movement Action</h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Sunrise Movement is a youth-led climate activist organization. Sunrise Movement Action is the political arm that endorses and helps elect candidates committed to a Green New Deal and rapid climate action. They emphasize youth organizing, climate justice, and linking environmental policies to jobs and equality.</p>
<p><strong>How they helped me:</strong> They bring energized youth volunteers, social media reach, and credibility on climate policy. They run phone banks, text campaigns, and high-impact youth voter registration drives—especially valuable in districts with many young or first-time voters.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 2023–24 federal cycle: ~$170k in outside spending (OpenSecrets), with significant value delivered through volunteer organizing and earned media.</p>
<p><strong>Why they would make a great fit:</strong> One of the main goals is an ambitious Green New Deal and climate justice; Sunrise’s endorsements signal authenticity to young voters and climate activists.</p>

<h1 class="display-2">Our Revolution</h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Our Revolution grew out of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign. It’s a progressive political organization and hybrid PAC that supports candidates who back Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, tuition-free college, and getting money out of politics. They focus on mobilizing grassroots supporters and building local chapters to sustain long-term progressive political support.</p>
<p><strong>How they can help me:</strong> They have a nationwide volunteer network and established credibility with Sanders-aligned progressives. They provide organizing tools, text-banking infrastructure, local chapter endorsements, and media amplification. Their base includes many small-dollar donors and experienced campaign volunteers who can boost turnout and visibility in primaries.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 2023–24 federal cycle: ~$1.8 million in outside spending (OpenSecrets), with most impact from coordinated organizing and local chapter activity.</p>
<p><strong>Why they fit my campaign:</strong> Their platform and rhetoric align almost perfectly with a populist left campaign—anti-corporate, pro-worker, and bold on healthcare and climate. Their grassroots infrastructure also mirrors the organizing model I’d want to emulate.</p>

<h1 class="display-2">Democracy for America (DFA)</h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Founded by former DNC Chair Howard Dean, DFA is one of the oldest progressive political action committees. It recruits and trains progressive candidates nationwide and supports issues like voting rights, economic fairness, and universal healthcare. They emphasize local empowerment, digital organizing, and building diverse progressive leadership.</p>
<p><strong>How they can help me:</strong> DFA provides access to progressive campaign training, digital organizing platforms, and coordinated email fundraising to their national list. Their endorsement still carries weight with long-time progressives and can open doors to alliances with local activist groups and experienced campaigners.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 2023–24 federal cycle: ~$1.2 million in outside spending (OpenSecrets), focused on digital and grassroots infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Why it fits my campaign:</strong> DFA combines national credibility with practical campaign training and digital infrastructure. For a progressive insurgent, they can fill the gap between big grassroots enthusiasm and the technical side of running a serious campaign operation.</p>

<h1 class="display-2">MoveOn Political Action</h1>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> MoveOn is one of the largest progressive digital advocacy networks in the U.S. It operates as a hybrid PAC that mobilizes millions of members to back progressive candidates and causes. Their focus areas include protecting democracy, climate action, reproductive rights, and economic justice. They specialize in rapid-response digital organizing and grassroots fundraising.</p>
<p><strong>How they can help me:</strong> MoveOn can blast out email and text campaigns to millions of engaged progressives, drive small-dollar donations, and mobilize volunteers for phone/text banking. Their digital ads and petition drives can also shape narratives quickly and help build a primary campaign around key issues.</p>
<p><strong>Money:</strong> 2023–24 federal cycle: ~$9.7 million in outside spending (OpenSecrets), mostly on independent expenditures supporting progressive candidates and opposing right-wing incumbents.</p>
<p><strong>Why it fits my campaign:</strong> MoveOn’s digital muscle and national reach can amplify a progressive insurgent message far beyond the district level. Their ability to raise money fast and flood social media with grassroots messages complements on-the-ground efforts from groups like WFP or Sunrise.</p>

<h1 class="display-2">Overall</h1>
<p><strong>Why I included six:</strong> I had to include a sixth because no AIPAC money really sucks when trying to build a campaign.</p>
