  <h1>Our History</h1>

<div class="row justify-content-center">
<div class="col-9">
    <h1 class="display-1">Progressive Movement (19th - 20th century):</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">The progressive movement was a reform movement focusing on both political and social reforms that majorly changed the United States. Coming off of the Gilded Age of American politics, a time rampant with corruption, along with mass industrialization and urbanization, the conditions of which were terrible for the workers. As such this was a time of mass unionization and increase in civil liberties, especially when it came to immigrant groups who were the most vulnerable of the groups.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">Some goals of the movement included strengthening the national government, and addressing demands by the people on economic, social and political issues. Common issues of the time included labor rights, women’s suffrage, economic reforms, environmental concerns, and welfare of the poor. Labor rights included better job quality for workers, a demand for an 8 hour work day, and child labor restrictions.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">Some major political figures that were advocates of progressivism included Theodore Roosevelt, Robert Wagner, William Taft and Jane Addams. Parties affiliated with this movement would include both Democrats and Republicans, along with the Bull Moose Party run by Theodore Roosevelt.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">Another later iteration of the progressives was founded by Henry Wallace in 1948. The Progressive party served as a platform for the candidacy of Wallace. Some of the policies sought by the Party included racial desegregation, national health insurance, expansion of welfare, nationalization of the energy industry, and conciliation with the Soviets.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">Wallace served as Roosevelt's vice president before being dropped from the ticket in 1944, and would rise as a contending voice to Truman’s cold war policies. In the 1948 Progressive National Convention, the nomination was between Wallace and Glen H. Dewey. In the election though, the Progressive only got 2.4% of the vote, a far smaller percentage than previous candidates such as Roosevelt and Robert M. La Follette garnered.</h1>

    <h1 class="display-1">Modern Progressive Party:</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">The modern progressive movement is within the Democratic party. Founded in 2004, the Progressive Democrats of America seek to build a party and government that is controlled by the people and not the corporate elite. Their policies support the public interests and not private interests. In contrast to the Democratic party which listens more to corporations and donors than the people, the PDA strives to rebuild the party from the bottom up, with input from the people on every step.</h1>

    <h1 class="display-1">Issues addressed by the Party:</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">The PDA is a party big on human rights, with it having a whole directive called Fund Human Needs/Cut Pentagon Waste. A big part of this being Healthcare Human Rights, with the PDA endorsing and working on Expanded and Improved Medicare for all, along with state based single payer universal health care plans.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">They feel deeply for the 27.5 million people with no reliable access to health care and the tens of millions of which have inadequate or overly expensive health care coverage. An equal rights amendment is another initiative the PDA unequivocally supports, being something that they will fight to make sure passes.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">Since the original 1982 failure to pass the amendment, Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia have ratified the ERA, with legislation being reintroduced in 2021 to remove the deadline, currently pending in the Senate.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">The End Corporate Rule Issue Organizing team was formed by the PDA to fight in the government for the common people in a time of major corporate and lobbyist control over the government. Ever since the Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case in 2010, the party has advocated at every level for an amendment to both overturn the Citizens United case, but also to declare that corporations are not persons with constitutional rights.</h1>
    <h1 class="display-1"  style="font-size: 20pt;">Common issues the organization deals with are opposing the privatization of the Postal Service and the efforts to privatize public education and fostering climate denial. They also advocate for Medicare being able to negotiate drug prices with companies, speak out against the privatization of prisons, and massive wealth and income inequalities facilitated by the manipulation of the tax code.</h1>
